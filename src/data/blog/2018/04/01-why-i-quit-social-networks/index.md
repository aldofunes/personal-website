There was a smart guy called _Dunbar_. He studied some animals and came to the conclusion that a person's social circle is limited to its brain's capacity to store information. In other words, we can only store so many individuals in our brain, the rest is just people. It may even sound mean, but tu us, people are outside our caring boundaries. This fella studied several poeple and decided that our limit is 150.

What? We can only remember 150 people? But hey, I have like 1,000+ friends in Facebook alone! That cannot be true!

It is a little bit more complicated that that. Knowing someone is different than caring for her. Let's do a quick exercise, grab a pen and paper, and (without looking to your Facebook) make a list of everyone you know. You may have super-memory, and I can still guarantee that you will struggle to write 50 names, let alone 150. This number is much lower in practice.
